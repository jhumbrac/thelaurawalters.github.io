				<h2>Women of Silicon Roundabout 2016 - The highlights</h2>
				<h3>January 3, 2017</h3>
				<h4>&hearts; 8</h4>
				<p>In October some of the ladies from TheTin went to the Women of Silicon Roundabout event in Kings Cross. We heard from some fantastic speakers and were inspired by the strides women have been making in the industry. On the flip side we were also a little daunted by the progress that clearly still needs to be made. These are our key takeaways from the event.</p>
				<p>There were conversations, presentations and panel discussions from Suzanne Timmons and Bjorn Bringert (Google), Melissa Di Donato (Salesforce), Naomi Gwendolyn Smit (Digital McKinsey) and Faz Aftab (ITV) etc. Throughout the event there were a few points that were repeatedly raised: unconscious bias, the importance of mentoring and sponsorship, the lack of role models and that equality in the workplace is not just the right thing to do - it’s also good for business.</p>

				<h2>What the heck is accessibility?!</h2>
				<h3>November 25, 2016</h3>
				<h4>&hearts; 15</h4>
				<p>With more and more aspects of our daily lives happening on screen, it’s never been more important as designers to make sure all of the content we create takes into account the needs of as many users as possible. So what is web accessibility? WebAIM estimates that roughly a fifth of the population have some form of disability or impairment. Now these impairments may not all be severe enough to make access to content difficult, but it is a significant number of users – potential customers - that could be excluded.</p>
				<p>To explain this better here’s a little metaphor… Imagine yourself arriving at an airport ready to go on your holiday. You know that you need to catch your flight, but you need a little help getting there. You find your check-in desk and drop off your luggage, go through security, have a bite to eat, wait for your gate to be displayed, navigate the airport to find your plane and jet off. Part of your ability to navigate the airport might be instinct - you’ve probably done it before. There’s also clever architecture and design that is subconsciously leading you in the right direction. This might be the tiles that are angled a certain way or the way that the roof slopes to show where you need to go. This is a real word example of what we call UX and UI in web design. The ability to visually lead the user to where you want them to go.</p>
